==Output Types==
*PanTilt* - Sends servo settings for pan and tilt servos ranging from 0 to 3000 and is completely GCS controlled and does not require any intelligence from the tracker's microcontroller. There is a calibration (end-point setup) in the GCS which allows servo travel and full travel angle to be specified. Once calibrated, the "north" angle must simply be set at the field. This means that the GCS must be told how many degrees off north the tracker is pointing (at zero or 1500us or the middle position of the pan servo). For example, if the tracker is heading due East, then the GCS should be told "90." This offset will allow the tracker to be pointed in directions other than due north. 
    
Current Output Format: !!!PAN:XXXX,TLT:YYYY+++ Where XXXX is pan servo micro seconds from 0000 to 3000 and YYYY is tilt server micro seconds from 0000 to 3000. These fields are fixed length at 4 characters. 

Sample Source Code for this output mode can be found in the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/happykillmore-gcs/downloads/detail?name=ArduTracker%20v1.zip&can=2&q='>ArduTracker</a> source for the original ArduPilot.

*Heading* - Sends angle settings from pan and tilt servos ranging from 0.0 to 359.0 for pan and -180.0 to 180.0 for tilt. All calibration and end-point adjustments have to be handled on the tracker's microcontroller. The assumption is that 1 degree of output equals 1 degree of movement on the tracker. The angle offset can still be used on the GCS or can be set to 0 and handled in the tracker's logic.
 
Current Output Format: !!!HED:X.X,ANG:Y.X+++ Where XXX.X is heading with one decimal place and YY.Y is tilt angle. These fields are not fixed length and may contain a negative for tilt.

*LatLong* - Sends ArduPilot Legacy commands including LAT, LON, ALT and requires all math functions to be completed on tracker. GCS does not perform any math relating to home and current plane location. All end-point adjustment, calibration and set home routines must be handled by the tracker.
 
Current Output Format: !!!LAT:XXXX.XXXXXX,LON:YYYYY.YYYYYY,ALT:Z.Z+++ Where X is Latitude, Y is Longitude and Z is Altitude. These fields are not fixed length. ALT will vary based on the selection of Altitude offset in the settings form. Either from sea level or from home location.

==Calibration==
After selecting PanTilt for Output Type on the Tracking tab and clicking Connect, a button labelled "Calibrate" will appear at the bottom right.

The purpose of this screen is to tweak the end-points of the servo's movement and to specify what angle those endpoints represent. 

*WARNING:* You can DAMAGE your servo using this tool! Please be VERY careful to make small adjustments towards the far left and far right of the slider!
