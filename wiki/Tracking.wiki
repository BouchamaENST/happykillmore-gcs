==Output Types==
*PanTilt* - Sends servo settings for pan and tilt servos ranging from 0 to 3000 and is completely GCS controlled and does not require any intelligence from the tracker's microcontroller. There is a calibration (end-point setup) in the GCS which allows servo travel and full travel angle to be specified. Once calibrated, the "north" angle must simply be set at the field. This means that the GCS must be told how many degrees off north the tracker is pointing (at zero or 1500us or the middle position of the pan servo). For example, if the tracker is heading due East, then the GCS should be told "90." This offset will allow the tracker to be pointed in directions other than due north. 
    
Current Output Format: !!!PAN:XXXX,TLT:YYYY+++ Where XXXX is pan servo micro seconds from 0000 to 3000 and YYYY is tilt server micro seconds from 0000 to 3000. These fields are fixed length at 4 characters. 

Sample Source Code for this output mode can be found in the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/happykillmore-gcs/downloads/detail?name=ArduTracker%20v1.zip&can=2&q='>ArduTracker</a> source for the original ArduPilot.

*Heading* - Sends angle settings from pan and tilt servos ranging from 0.0 to 359.0 for pan and -180.0 to 180.0 for tilt. All calibration and end-point adjustments have to be handled on the tracker's microcontroller. The assumption is that 1 degree of output equals 1 degree of movement on the tracker. The angle offset can still be used on the GCS or can be set to 0 and handled in the tracker's logic.
 
Current Output Format: !!!HED:X.X,ANG:Y.X+++ Where XXX.X is heading with one decimal place and YY.Y is tilt angle. These fields are not fixed length and may contain a negative for tilt.

*LatLong* - Sends ArduPilot Legacy commands including LAT, LON, ALT and requires all math functions to be completed on tracker. GCS does not perform any math relating to home and current plane location. All end-point adjustment, calibration and set home routines must be handled by the tracker.
 
Current Output Format: !!!LAT:XXXX.XXXXXX,LON:YYYYY.YYYYYY,ALT:Z.Z+++ Where X is Latitude, Y is Longitude and Z is Altitude. These fields are not fixed length. ALT will vary based on the selection of Altitude offset in the settings form. Either from sea level or from home location.

==Calibration==
After selecting PanTilt for Output Type on the Tracking tab and clicking Connect, a button labelled "Calibrate" will appear at the bottom right.

The purpose of this screen is to tweak the end-points of the servo's movement and to specify what angle those endpoints represent. 

*WARNING:* You can DAMAGE your servo using this tool! Please be VERY careful to make small adjustments towards the far left and far right of the slider!

Start with the top slider labelled "Left" under Pan end-point calibration. Move the slider to the left and make sure that the servo pans left. If it's backwards, then slide the slider to the right to make the servo go left. Listen to your servos. As you get close to the end of your servo's travel abilities, the servo will start to make a straining sound and will stop moving. Once you have found this point, back off slightly. Now, you'll need to set the angle for this deflection. Many servos will only travel 90 degrees left and 90 degrees right. If you have a servo that can travel a greater distance, then you can specify a larger angle value. You may want to use a protractor to determine the actual angle.

Repeat these instructions for Left, right, up and down. The angle values are important as the combination of end-points and angles are what the GCS uses to point the antenna at your plane. It is also recommended that you specify a down angle less than 0 if your equipment can physically handle it. In some cases, if you're using "Side and Back Lobe" (see below), your antenna may need to point at the ground at a heading 180 degrees off to get the best signal.

==Tracking - Offset==
On the tracking tab is a value labelled "Offset" this is used to tell the system what direction your antenna tracker is pointed when at the "0" heading. For example, if your antenna tracker is pointed due East the you would select "90" in the offset value. Use a compass to determine your heading. It is VERY important to set this value before trying to fly. Without specifying an offset, the GCS will assume your antenna tracker is pointed due North and this can cause for some serious problems.

==Use side & back lobes when flying behind antenna==
This checkbox may help overcome limitations in your pan servo travel. If you plan on flying 360 degrees around your tracker then I strongly suggest designing a geared solution or purchasing special servos that can allow for full 360 degree rotation. If you do not plan on flying behind your antenna tracker, then I would suggest selecting "Use side & back lobes when flying behind antenna" just in case. Here's how it works.

Every patch antenna has a main lobe, 2 side lobes and a back lobe. The intent of the antenna tracker is to keep the main lobe pointed towards the plane at all times. This will give the clearest signal and the best range. It your antenna tracker only gets 90 degrees of rotation to the left and the right, then you only have 180 degrees covered. In this case, without "Use side & back lobes when flying behind antenna" selected, the tracker will simply turn all the way left and stay there until the plane gets closer to the right side and then the tracker will rotate all the way right. This will probably result in lost signal for a portion of the time the plane is behind the antenna.

However, in looking at the diagram above, you can see that there are two fairly good sized side lobes that can be used while the plane is behind the antenna. By selecting "Use side & back lobes when flying behind antenna" as soon as the plane passes 90 degrees left, the antenna will rotate 90 degrees right in an attempt to place the plane in the left side lobe. It will try to follow the plane and keep it in the left lobe until it reaches the left end-point, at which time it will rotate to the right side lobe and continue rotating until the plane can be reached by the main lobe again. 

In some cases, the servos will not allow for 180 degrees of travel and in this worst-case-scenario, the GCS will try to use the tiny back lobes when the plane is near 180 degrees off the tracker's 0 degree mark. In this situation, the antenna will point directly away from the plane and attempt to tilt down towards the ground in an attempt to best line up the back lobe with the plane. The range is very small on the back lobes so this is not a good way to fly.
